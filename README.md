A very large custom void world, **VoidWorld\_CrazyBreeze.mcworld**,
originally purposed for **[SkyBlock Bedrock
Edition](https://raythco.uk/downloads/mcworlds/skyblockbe)**. Contains
hard coded spawn spots for Ocean Monuments (x16), Pillager Outposts
(x4), Swamp Huts (x4), and Nether Fortresses (x16). Also contains large
areas for 16 overworld biomes and 4 nether biomes.
